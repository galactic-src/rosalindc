Problem

For a collection of strings, a larger string containing every one of the smaller strings as a substring is called a superstring.

By the assumption of parsimony, a shortest possible superstring over a collection of reads serves as a candidate chromosome.

Given: At most 50 DNA strings whose length does not exceed 1 kbp in FASTA format (which represent reads deriving from the same strand of a single linear chromosome).

The dataset is guaranteed to satisfy the following condition: there exists a unique way to reconstruct the entire chromosome from these reads by gluing together pairs of reads that overlap by more than half their length.

Return: A shortest superstring containing all the given strings (thus corresponding to a reconstructed chromosome).
