For a fixed positive integer k order all possible k-mers taken from an underlying alphabet lexicographically.

Then the k-mer composition of a string s can be represented by an array A for which A[m] denotes the number of times that the mmth k-mer (with respect to the lexicographic order) appears in s.

Given: A DNA string s in FASTA format (having length at most 100 kbp).

Return: The 4-mer composition of s.
